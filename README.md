# space-defender-game
This is a simple 3D space shooting game built with Unity. The idea of the game is to survive as many waves as possible without letting the enemies destroy your base.

I created this game purely as a development project to learn from.

The game contains two main scenes.

## Testing
This project uses AltUnity to implement a simple UI test project.

It also includes a custom build script (for windows64) that can be used to build the game from the command line. 

## Continuous Integration
This repo also includes a sample .yaml file that is represents a CI pipeline that can be implemented in Azure DevOps. If you have a build server containing Unity, you can execute
this and automate your game build and test process.
